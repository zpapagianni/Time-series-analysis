# Time-series-analysis

## Description
We consider the time series data provided in the accompanying file [time-series.csv](./time-series.csv) and we assume that this data contains daily observations of some variable of interest. After loading the data, we analyse its compoments and implement a standard Dickey-Fuller test to the residual time series.

## Setup
* See [Time-series-analysis.md](./Time-series-analysis.md) for the report of the project.
* See [Time-series-analysis.R](./Time-series-analysis.R) for code


This repository shows a set of R markdown files that I used to analyse the data provided in the accompanying file [time-series.csv](./time-series.csv). The [dataset](./time-series.csv) for this project was given as part of an assingment to improve our understanding of time series. This quick and easy tutorial demonstrates how to analyse a time series' components and apply a common Dickey-Fuller test to the residual time series.

Here are the different notebooks:
* [Time-series-analysis.R](./Time-series-analysis.R): Contains the code that was used for the analysis.
* [Time-series-analysis.md](./Time-series-analysis.md): The rmarkdown file that contains the detailed step of the analysis.
* [time-series.csv](./time-series.csv): Input data.
