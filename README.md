# Time-series-analysis

## Description
We consider the time series data provided in the accompanying file [time-series.csv](./time-series.csv) and we assume that this data contains daily observations of some variable of interest. After loading the data, we analyse its compoments and implement a standard Dickey-Fuller test to the residual time series.

## Setup
* See [Time-series-analysis.md](./Time-series-analysis.md) for the report of the project.
* See [Time-series-analysis.R](./Time-series-analysis.R) for code
