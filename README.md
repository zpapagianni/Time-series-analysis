# Time-series-analysis

## Description

This repository shows a set of R markdown files that I used to analyse the data provided in the accompanying file [time-series.csv](./time-series.csv). The [dataset](./time-series.csv) for this project was given as part of an assingment to improve our understanding of time series and  it represents daily observations of some random variable of interest. This quick and easy tutorial demonstrates how to analyse a time series' components and apply a common Dickey-Fuller test to the residual time series.

Here are the different notebooks:
* [Time-series-analysis.R](./Time-series-analysis.R): Contains the code that was used for the analysis.
* [Time-series-analysis.md](./Time-series-analysis.md): The rmarkdown file that contains the detailed step of the analysis.
* [time-series.csv](./time-series.csv): Input data.
